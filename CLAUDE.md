# Mother — project notes for Claude Code

This repo is the Mother plugin: a local background-work orchestrator that
dispatches Claude Code sessions against self-contained plans. See `README.md`
for product-level detail.

## Layout cheatsheet

- `plugins/mother/bin/` — user-facing CLIs. `mother` is the main entry point;
  `mother-runner` is the long-running daemon; `mother-run-job` is the
  per-job worker spawned by the daemon (or by `mother run --once`);
  `mother-switcher` is the fzf popup.
- `plugins/mother/lib/` — sourced shell libs (`state.sh`, `worktree.sh`,
  `locks.sh`). The libs do not call `set -u` themselves; they inherit it
  from whichever bin sources them.
- `plugins/mother/launchd/` — macOS launchd plist template installed by
  `mother daemon install`.
- `.claude/bug-reports/` — inbox for filed bug reports (see below).

Runtime state lives in `~/.mother/` (jobs, events, logs, locks, runner state).
It is never tracked in the repo and `.gitignore` already excludes `.mother/`.

## Shell conventions

- All bin scripts run under `set -u`. Any external env var reference
  (`$TMUX`, `$EDITOR`, etc.) MUST use the `${VAR:-default}` form — a bare
  `$VAR` will crash the script when the var is unset, and since workers are
  spawned by the daemon with stderr discarded, the failure is silent. Use
  `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-unknown}` / `${TMUX:-}` as the reference pattern.
- macOS ships `/bin/bash` as 3.2.57. Do not rely on post-3.2 features
  (e.g. `declare -A`, `mapfile`, reliable `export -f` across
  `bash -c` boundaries) in scripts that may be invoked by fzf, tmux
  popups, or `sh -c` wrappers. When a child shell needs access to a
  function defined in a parent script, prefer self-invocation
  (`"$0" --emit-foo`) over `export -f` + `bash -c`.
- Use `_job_update` (in `mother-run-job`) or `_job_update <id> <filter>`
  (in `lib/state.sh`) to mutate job JSON — both go through an atomic
  write. Don't hand-edit the json files.

## Bug report workflow

Bug reports are filed as markdown under `.claude/bug-reports/` (this
directory is in the user's global gitignore, so these are local notes,
not committed artifacts). Convention:

1. **New reports** land in `.claude/bug-reports/` as
   `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`. They describe symptom, root cause, suggested
   fix, and ideally a reproducer.
2. **When you fix one**:
   - Make the fix in a normal commit with a descriptive subject
     (`fix: …`). Don't reference the bug-report file in the commit
     message — the reports are local and the commit has to stand on
     its own for anyone reading `git log`.
   - Append a footer to the bug report before archiving:
     ```
     ---

     **Resolved:** <short-sha> — <commit subject>
     ```
   - Move the file into `.claude/bug-reports/resolved/`.
3. `.claude/bug-reports/` is the live inbox — anything there is still
   open. `.claude/bug-reports/resolved/` is the audit trail.

Don't delete resolved reports. The standalone narrative
("here's what was broken and why") is more useful for future debugging
than the commit message alone, and the resolved footer ties it back to
the fix.
